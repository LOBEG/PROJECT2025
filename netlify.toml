# =============================================================================
# FINAL CORRECTED NETLIFY CONFIGURATION
# This file corrects the build output, environment variables, and rewrite rules.

[build]
  # ✅ FIX: React/Vite projects build to the "build" directory, not "dist".
  # This ensures your latest code is actually deployed.

# --- Redirect and Rewrite Rules ---

# Rule 1: API Function Proxy
# This rule MUST come first. It proxies API calls to your backend functions.
# `force = true` is critical to prevent the SPA rule from overriding it.

  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

# Rule 2: Single-Page Application (SPA) Fallback
# This rule MUST come last. It ensures any direct visit to a frontend route
# (like /auth/callback) correctly loads the React application.

  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# --- Header Rules ---
# The default Netlify headers are sufficient. The previous header rules
# have been removed to prevent potential conflicts.
